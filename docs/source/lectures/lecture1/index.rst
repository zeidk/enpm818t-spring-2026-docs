L1: Course Introduction
====================================================

Overview
--------

This lecture introduces the ENPM818T course, covering its structure,
grading policies, and assignment progression.  You will learn why
structured data management matters, explore storage hierarchies and
their speed-cost-capacity trade-offs, compare storage architectures
(DAS, NAS, SAN, Object, and Cloud), and get an overview of PostgreSQL's
history, architecture, and ecosystem.  The session ends with hands-on
environment setup — installing PostgreSQL, DataGrip, Python, and VS Code.
