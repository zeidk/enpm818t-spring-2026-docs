Overview
--------

The lectures in ENPM818T follow a progressive structure, starting with data storage fundamentals and relational database design, then building toward NoSQL technologies and polyglot persistence architectures. Each lecture introduces new concepts through explanation, live demonstrations, and hands-on exercises. Lecture materials, including slides and demo scripts, are available on Canvas.

.. tip::

   Review the exercises after each lecture and re-run them on your own machine. Experimenting with queries and schemas is the fastest way to internalize the concepts.
