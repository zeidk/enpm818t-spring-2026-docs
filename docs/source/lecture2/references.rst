        **ENPM818T — L2: Conceptual Data Modeling**

        Covers the role of conceptual modeling in database design, Entity-Relationship
        diagrams using Chen notation, entities (strong vs. weak), attributes
        (simple, composite, multivalued, derived), keys (superkey, candidate key,
        primary key, partial key), relationships with cardinality and participation
        constraints, Extended ER concepts (specialization/generalization, aggregation,
        categories), and a complete university system use case walkthrough.
